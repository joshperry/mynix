# This script opens a new tmux pane in the style of my preferred dev UI using
# fzf to allow fuzzily finding the project dir I want to work in.
#
# I put my code under ~/dev so it lists folders 2-deep from there. There is no
# interface the target dir has to expose, though this pairs quite well with
# .envrc + flakes and devenv (cref: `josh.nix` programs.direnv).
#
# With a decent powerline config for your PS1, vim status, tmux
# status, and i3 status below that, you get a pretty information
# dense environment over a wide range of hierarchical contexts.
#
# Pane 0 is always my bootstrap pane, I use this mostly for running
# this script but sometimes one-off commands(every window has a shell,
# so it's rare).
#
# Using tmux-fzf paired with panes named by the chosen directory makes
# navigating these contexts dynamic and quick. 
#
# 75% vim with file tree expanded 
# ---------
# 25% shell
# [tmux 0> pane 1> list 2>]
